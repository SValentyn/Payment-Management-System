# Appeal to all future contributors!

The development of a large-scale project is rather difficult for one. If someone looking at this project has a desire to join, 
I will tell you in detail about the components of the system and tell you how to improve it and take into account your recommendations and wishes.  

`You can help with this:`

+ Reporting a bug
+ Reviewing the code
+ Submitting a fix
+ Proposing new features
+ Becoming a maintainer

## Branches

The following branches are used to manage the project:
+ `master` is tested, stable and ready for production.
+ `feature, bug` these are contributors branches, that may contain proposing new features, reporting a bug etc.

## How to report bugs

I use GitHub issues to track bugs. Write bug reports with all the details, screenshots and a possible source of code problems.  
A special template was prepared for this. You can report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new/choose).

## How to contribute code

I use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. 
I welcome your pull request. To do this, you need the following:

+ Create a new branch based on 'feature' or 'bug'.
+ Implement your changes.
+ Add tests if applicable.
+ Clear your code (refactor the code and make sure that there are no new errors and side effects).
+ Release pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](../master/LICENSE) that covers the project.
